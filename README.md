## Abstract
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. This project explores the use of machine learning to predict diabetes based on medical and demographic features. Three modelsâ€”XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regressionâ€”were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Data balancing techniques like SMOTE were applied to improve performance. Results indicate that XGBoost performed best, achieving a **97.57% accuracy**.

## Introduction
Early diabetes prediction can enhance patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Traditional methods, like blood tests, are resource-intensive. Machine learning offers a faster, data-driven alternative. This study compares **XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression** on a structured dataset, assessing their effectiveness in diabetes classification.

---

## Conclusion
XGBoost and Random Forest significantly outperformed Logistic Regression, with **97.57% and 96.95% accuracy, respectively**. Their precision, recall, and F1-score were consistently high. Logistic Regression, at **89.26% accuracy**, struggled to handle data complexity. Overall, **XGBoost proved the most reliable** model for diabetes prediction.

## Future Work
Further improvements can be made by:
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for XGBoost and Random Forest using grid/random search.
- **Ensemble techniques** like boosting or stacking for enhanced performance.
- **Feature engineering** to create new predictive variables.
- Exploring advanced models like **LightGBM and CatBoost** for structured data classification.
